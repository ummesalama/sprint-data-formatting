We need to restrict Emergency loan from app if the subscriber has requested for migration port-out.,SKTAPP-809,12523,,Task,Done,SKTAPP,Skitto App,software,admin,,,Highest,Done,kafi,admin,admin,17/Jul/18 2:12 PM,02/Oct/18 3:42 PM,19/Dec/18 2:00 PM,02/Oct/18 3:42 PM,,,0,Backend,Retainer,"We need to restrict Emergency loan from app if the subscriber has requested for migration port-out. We need to add a validation in the ""request_loan"" API before calling the i-new ""requestLoan"" SOAP API.

So to check the port-out flag status, we need to use the below API:

Model API : https://10.21.3.153:8243/services/mnpService?wsdl
Production API: https://10.21.7.153:8243/services/mnpService?wsdl

When ""port out flag"" is set as 0 , subscriber is unable to take emergency loan.

{code}
Check Port-out flag :

<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:end=""http://endpoint.api.mnp.gp.inew.com/"">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <end:checkPortOutInProgressFlag>
         <!--Optional:-->
         <request>
            <!--Optional:-->
            <mnpRequest>
               <!--Optional:-->
               <serviceType>CRM</serviceType>
               <!--Optional:-->
               <simIdentifier>
                  <!--Optional:-->
                  <msisdn>8801714310289</msisdn>
               </simIdentifier>
               <!--Optional:-->
               <user>tamim</user>
            </mnpRequest>
         </request>
      </end:checkPortOutInProgressFlag>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>

Response :

<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"">
   <soap:Body>
      <ns2:checkPortOutInProgressFlagResponse xmlns:ns2=""http://endpoint.api.mnp.gp.inew.com/"">
         <return>
            <portOutStatus>FLAG_SET</portOutStatus>
            <successIdentificator>
               <responseCode>0</responseCode>
               <responseMessage>Check port out flag was successfull</responseMessage>
               <successIdentifier>OK</successIdentifier>
            </successIdentificator>
         </return>
      </ns2:checkPortOutInProgressFlagResponse>
   </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
{code}

So the logic will be like this
{code}
If (migration port out requested)
 throw an error
else 
call the ""requestLoan"" API of i-new
{code}

",,admin,hasan.m.rahman,kafi,tasmia.safa,,"MNP Checking implemented and code pushed to model server. Checked at model server and it's working. 

Logic: Implemented API response as following by testing 01770168228

SimpleXMLElement Object
(
    [portOutStatus] => NA
    [successIdentificator] => SimpleXMLElement Object
        (
            [responseCode] => 8
            [responseMessage] => Port out process for the specified MSISDN not found
            [successIdentifier] => FAILED
        )
)

Checking responseCode zero or greater. 
If responseCode greater then zero, considering it's not ported out and go ahead. 
I have checked by reversing the flag for ported out. NO real case tested.

Process flow

1. 
Calling getProfile API to pick up MSISDN from subscriber id
2. 
Calling MNP checking API with MSISDN to check port out or not

If it's valid, going as it is for loan availability check or request.
